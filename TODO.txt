The following is a list of items that are open for development by
others. If you would like to do one of these items, or something else
that you have thought of that is not listed, please let your intentions
be known to Jeff Lawson <bovine@distributed.net>

==========

- graph performance on several contests at the same time with a different 
color for each.

- add a "Status bar" and display the progress/notification messages
there, instead of painting them within the graph window.

- add a persisted Most-Recently-Used list of log filenames that have
been loaded by the log visualizer.
