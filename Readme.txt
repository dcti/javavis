This is a Java Application (not Applet) that attempts to provide
functionality that is similar to the distributed.net Win32 Log
Visualizer, but in a Java implementation that should be equally usable
on many other platforms that have full Java implementations. It allows
you to load the text log file that are produced by the distributed.net
client and graphically view trends in actual keyrate produced by the
client.

This application uses AWT and should be runnable on all Java 1.1 virtual
machine implementations. It is being distributed as a JAR archive file
containing all of the pre-compiled Java class files.



If you have the Sun JAVA SDK installed, execute this JAR with:
	java -jar JavaVis.jar

If you have the Microsoft Java VM installed, execute this JAR with:
	jview /cp:a JavaVis.jar JavaVis.class



The Java source code is available in the enclosed zip file.
