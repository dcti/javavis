The MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java) installed with MacOs by default is not
capable of running Java-applications. It can only handle appletts.

There is an application-runner ("JBindery") in the MRJ-SDK (MRJ-Software
Developement Kit) wich is free downloadable from apples website
<http://developer.apple.com/java/classic.html> but hardly any user has
installed it.

But if MRJ-SDK is installed, running .jar files is rather easy:

It's just dragging 'JavaVis.jar' on the JBindery Icon and clicking 'Run'.

You can allso save the program as a MacOS-binary from JBindary ('save
settings...'), that will only require MRJ to be installed.


There is some code in the sourcefile 'JavaVis.java' that will will enable
drag&drop and other features on MacOs. But this has to be uncommented first
and then the whole application has to be compiled again.

There are some more sophisticated enhancements like adding resources to
controll the menus and some packing stuff for stand-allone applications.

If you want to see how this may be done download, unpack and examine the
standalone version provided at <http://michael.nahrath.de/dnet/JavaVis/>!

There may be more and more current information on this website as well.
