Subject: Re: Java LogVis update


background:
The MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java) installed with MacOs by default is not
capable of running Java-applications. It can only handle appletts.

There is an application-runner ("JBindery") in the MRJ-SDK (MRJ-Software
Developement Kit) wich is free downloadable from apples website
<http://apple.com/java/> but hardly any user has installed it.

I ran the 1.1 with it.
It's just dragging RC5graph.jar on the JBindery Icon and clicking 'Run'.

You can allso save te program as a MacOs-binary from JBindary, that will
only require MRJ to be installed.

That's what I did with the corrected RC5graph.jar Yves sent to me last week
and with the 1.1 today (i had sent Yves some bug-reports on the 1.0).


- this binary uses up to 35 MBytes of temorary memory.
I don't know if this is a problem of JBindery, of your code or if I have
done something wrong on compiling.
- A real MacOs application should also include some MacOs-specific
Information like a Creator-Code, Version-resource etc.
I can not do that, because i have no programming-experience on MacOs at all.
